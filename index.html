    <h1>COVID-19 Vaccines: Myth Versus Fact</h1>

        <h4><b>Fact - </b></h4>
        <p>Some participants in the vaccine clinical trials did report
          side effects similar to those experienced with other vaccines,
          including muscle pain, chills and headache. And although extremely
          rare, people can have severe allergic reactions to ingredients
          used in a vaccine. That’s why experts recommend people with a
          history of severe allergic reactions — such as anaphylaxis — to
          the ingredients of the vaccine should not get the vaccination.

        <h4><b>Fact - </b></h4>
        <p>The authorized vaccines are proven safe and effective. Although they were developed in record time, they have
          gone through the same rigorous Food and Drug Administration process as other vaccines, meeting all safety
          standards. No steps were skipped. Instead, we can thank the unprecedented worldwide collaboration and
          investment for the shorter timeframe on the development of the vaccines. The clinical trials and safety
          reviews actually took about the same amount of time as other vaccines.

        </div>
        <h4><b>Fact - </b></h4>
        <p>The first vaccines granted emergency use authorization contain messenger RNA (mRNA), which instructs cells to
          make the “spike protein” found on the new coronavirus. When the immune system recognizes this protein, it
          builds an immune response by creating antibodies — teaching the body how to protect against future infection.
          The mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept. The body
          gets rid of the mRNA soon after it’s finished using the instructions.

        </div>
        <h4><b>Fact - </b></h4>
        <p>Misinformation on social media suggests the vaccine trains the body to attack syncytin-1, a protein in the
          placenta, which could lead to infertility in women. The truth is, there’s an amino acid sequence shared
          between the spike protein and a placental protein; however, experts say it’s too short to trigger an immune
          response and therefore doesn’t affect fertility.

        <h4><b>Fact - </b></h4>
        <p>Regardless of your risk, you can still contract the infection and spread it to others, so it’s important you
          get vaccinated. Once the vaccine is widely available, it’s recommended that as many eligible adults as
          possible get the vaccine. It’s not only to protect you but your family and community as well.

        <h4><b>Fact - </b></h4>
        <p>There is no evidence to suggest that getting the vaccine heightens your risk to become sick from another
          infection such as the flu.

        </div>
        <h4><b>Ans - </b></h4>
        <p>Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you 
          already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet 
          know how long you are protected from getting sick again 
          after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already 
          recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that 
          you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 
          again. If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies 
          or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting 
          a COVID-19 vaccine.

        <h4><b>Ans - </b></h4>
        <p>No. Fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. If you are fully vaccinated, you can resume activities that you did before the pandemic.

        <h4><b>Ans - </b></h4>
        <p>After getting vaccinated, you might have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. Common side effects are pain, redness, and swelling in the arm where you received the shot, as well as tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea throughout the rest of the body. These side effects could affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days.

        <h4><b>Ans - </b></h4>
        <p>Yes, if you are pregnant, you can receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
          You might want to have a conversation with your healthcare provider to help you decide whether to get vaccinated. While such a conversation might be helpful, it is not required before vaccination.

        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="./Images/Q5.jpg" alt="Avatar">
        </div>
        <h4><b>Ans - </b></h4>
        <p>We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice.
          Experts are working to learn more about both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.

        </div>
        <h4><b>Ans - </b></h4>
        <p>No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.
